			<h1 id="this-document-will-attempt-to-explain-my-keybindings">This document will attempt to explain my keybindings</h1>
			<p>(these wont make sense unless you&#39;re on a computer with an alt right next to each of your thumbs)</p>
			<h3 id="text-navigation">Text navigation</h3>
			<p>(basic)</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Alt+h = left arrow</li>
			<li>Alt+j = down arrow</li>
			<li>Alt+k = up arrow</li>
			<li>Alt+l =  right arrow</li>
			</ul>
			<p>(slightly more advanced )</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Alt+n = start of line</li>
			<li>Alt+m = end of line</li>
			<li>Alt+a = Select all</li>
			<li>Alt+d = delete key (not backspace)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These are quite helpful and make typing much faster. The ideas for the first four atleast were taken from vim, but I dont actually like vim all that much becase of it&#39;s modal nature, the micro text editor is what I like generally. Arrow keys have lots
			of functoinality and it&#39;s really nice to thave them without leaving the home row</p>
			<h3 id="window-navigation">Window navigation</h3>
			<ul>
			<li>Alt+w = Toggle maximization state of window</li>
			<li>Alt+p = Push tile right</li>
			<li>Alt+y = Push tile left</li>
			<li>Alt+, = Close window</li>
			<li>Alt+/ = minimize window</li>
			<li>Alt+\ = Alt+tab (so you can alt tab just using your right hand) (doesnt work exactly right, have to look into that)</li>
			<li>Alt+Spacebar = Bring up main menu (pain to specify in linux mint, you have to right click on the menu icon in bottom left corner)</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 id="browser-specific-i-use-chrome-">Browser specific (I use chrome)</h3>
			<ul>
			<li>Alt+u = Move left a tab</li>
			<li>Alt+i = open a new tab</li>
			<li>Alt+o = Move right a tab</li>
			<li>Alt+. = close tab</li>
			<li>Alt+8 = new chrome window</li>
			</ul>
			<h3 id="misc">Misc</h3>
			<ul>
			<li>Alt+e = escape key (I like this better than switching escape and caps lock)</li>
			<li>Alt+t = brings up terminal</li>
			<li>Alt+s = ctrl+s to save (although this seems to break in freecad)</li>
			<li>Alt+; = goes to search bar in chrome (thinking of changing as that&#39;s prime finger real estate)</li>
			<li>Also thinking of mapping Printscreen+right side of keyboard to type the left side so you can completely navigate with your right hand (printscreen needs to map to noting to make this work so you dont just take lots of photos)</li>
			<li>Alt+1 = locks computer screen</li>
			<li>Alt+0 = also escape key but for right hand</li>
			</ul>
			<p>(both left alt and right alt should work for these bindings)</p>
			<ul>
			<li>you can also select text in a text editor char by char or line by line by pressing Alt+Shift+hjkl or n or m </li>
			</ul>
			<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>
			<p>To make chrome actually usable you have to do a whole lot of modding, and honestly I&#39;d switch to duck duck go if the branding and name werent such garbage.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>First I have Ublock origin because the internet with ads is garbage</li>
			<li>I also have vimium installed but disabled on any page with google.com in the begining so I can use nav, a custom navigator to go through tabs quicker using j and k to go down the results (duck duck go already has this, but not the option to open in a new tab, man I might switch, but for now we&#39;re stuck)
			(vimium helps with smooth scrolling up and down pages using j and k)</li>
			<li>I also have infinite scroll which combines the second, third, fourth, etc page into the first one because I do not care if something is on the first or second page, if i want to open more results I will open more results</li>
			</ul>
			<p>notes</p>
			<p>I use the micro text editor</p>
