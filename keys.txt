(I mainly use a tool called input remapper to make all these possible but some must be set in keyboard settings of linux mint)

in my ~/.bashrc file i have these aliases

alias des="cd ~/Desktop"
alias dow="cd ~/Downloads"
alias books="cd ~/Desktop/books"
alias find="find . -iname"


For a text editor I use the Micro Text editor https://micro-editor.github.io/
To have good copy paste, install xsel, ie, type "sudo apt install xsel" into your terminal



For a browser I use firefox in dark mode with ublock, vimium, ai overview hider, and nav (extension I created, availabe on firefox store), also infy-scroll
All these make a browser usable
