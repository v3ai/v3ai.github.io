		<h3>About me:</h3>
		<p>- Currently a student</p>
		<p>- I build things occasionally</p>
		<p>- Uncertain of future plans</p>
		<p>- Collecter of useless knowledge</p>
		<p>- Blog entry <a href="./rfc/index.html">RFC:1</a> <-- read it</p>
		<h3>Beliefs:</h3>
		<p>
		- Do things for the joy and use you get from doing them, not because 
		you think someone else would like them. ie paint paintings because 
		you love painting, not because you want someone else to like your paintings.
		</p>
		<p>
		- I deleted my linkedin, I don't really think anyone likes linkedin and 
		so I opted out. 
		</p>
		<p>
		- The bar for achievment only goes up each generation. What was once considered remarkble will now only be considered average. (ex. average math classes taken by highschoolers going up, or see complexity of modern world)
