            I have a difficult time learning. Not because I can't absorb knoledge, but because I spend lots of time wondering if what I'm learning is true or not.
            Maybe there's a faster way to learn. When an artist is painting a painting they do not paint it pixel by pixel perfectly on the first go. What usually
            happens, say if you were painting a landscape is the following. First paint a background, then maybe paint some clouds, then paint some land in the front
            covering up some of the background, then maybe some trees, then some highlights where the light might hit the trees, etc etc. What if you looked at learning like this
            (as I'm writing this I'm realizing that this is how most people probobly learn). Step 1, accept everything as truth, Step 2 when you notice a contradiction, examine
            and figure out which of either is the real truth, step 3 GOTO step 1. What are the drawbacks to this? Well, you will probobly believe some false things for some
            period of time. This is not good. However if you believe that whatever you're learning has a low likelyhood of being false (ie, information without an agenda: ie math, engineering)
            you'll be able to learn much faster. It may also be that what you learn is not exactly wrong, but a simplification, and as the painter makes refinement to the painting, covering over
            the background, so too will you make refinements to your knowledge. This is easy to accept when learning science, if you don't believe it, try it! But harder in my 
            opinion when learning history. History seems to be often distorted. I was never taught that christopher columbus discovered america, although it seems my parents were.
            Do people internalize that history really happened? It's hard for me to believe when all we have are written accounts. Can you test that socrates was alive at one point?
            Well, kinda no, although lots of people say he was and there are books that bear the name, and everyone pretty much agrees that he was alive. How about Jesus? he was
            born after socrates, and it seems like people remember there being a jesus, but did he turn water into wine? Not to hate on history though I've changed my
            tune, I think history is important. Not really for the old addage of "People who forget history yada yada", But I think it shows you that people of old weren't really
            too different than you. (although I dont't really belive socrates was the people of old, we're talking about a few thousand years here)

            There are some problems with this. Imagine a highly opressive country that regulates information very tightly (although In reality there would likely be quiet talks of the truth you may hear).
            You might just go along being a sucker, a lemming, (although these terms are a bit harsh for someone with no other source of information). I think there's a tradeoff 
            between speed and acuracy, and there may be other factors. Never accepting anything as true is not all that fun. I think having an open mind, skeptisim, and an acceptance 
            of some things as truth is good. Truth does shrink when questioned, it only grows more true. Falsehoods are proved false when questioned.
