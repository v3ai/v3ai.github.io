	        I'm realizing how hard it actually is to have new ideas, make original things, etc. I was wondering if I had actually ever done anything new in my life.
	        Probobly a few things, and there's something to be said that everyone is living an entirely differnt life that has never been lived before, but there
	        are defentely some common feelings, wants, uncertainties that everyone has and that are not something that's new in the realm of humans. Have I built anything new?
	        Have I thought anything new? It's at this point that I feel it's important to distinguish between important/useful, and new. Farmers aren't doing anything new,
	        but they provide immense value to each of our lives. There is a incomprehensable mountain of novel bs that's useful to nobody. Thing's don't have to be new to
	        provide value to our lives. But the question has been asked, have I done anything new? Some very limited things. <a href="https://www.chessvariants.com/rules/stoneschess">Stones chess</a>
	        is probobly in there, which is funny because it took me what feels like 5 seconds to come up with it, but it's not really all that useful to people,
	        atleast right now. Maybe some people that I don't know have stumbled upon it and given it a go and I've played some with my friends. I was apart of 
	        a team that made some cool interfaces between scanning tunneling microscopes and haptic devices, but something that might be suprising was that 
	        that overall idea had been done before, and we mostly pushed through exploring the area a bit, and if some people that I worked on that with
	        happen to be reading this I would like to offer immense grattitude to be able to do something so cool. I think I helped a bit, mostly learning, good fun.
	        I've fixed up an old volkswagen, fixed some mopeds, fixed some things. I think that the ego has a tendency to make you want to think you're so important, and special,
	        and like I said in some ways we all are, but I really don't feel all that special. What have I done? Maybe that's a good thing college gives you. It shows you 
	        just how much you don't know, puts you in check. I'm going to registering for classes as a junior in a few days. I think I've grown more comfortable with not wanting anything.
	        I feel that the best things in life are free.

	        As a rant against modern culture for a second I think it encourages people to lie and be dishonest and pompus about what you're done. Just becasue you made something new
	        does not mean that it has any value. Imagine I make a household appliance that's a giant ball with every cooking utensil you'd ever need on it. New? probobly. Useful to anyone?
	        probobly not. I dislike the current buisness model and silicon valley culture as a whole. Promise something, get a bunch of money, then figure out if it's possible, or cost effective? Does
	        anyone think that's an honest way to make a product? The goal is in my mind not to make a product, but to just make money.
	         There are ofcourse lots of people who make real things in the bay area who I have of respect for. Maybe part of the 
	        problem is that you just have to be at such a high level to even decern bs. "We're revolutionizing xyz" should be a claim that nessitates a lot of evidence.
	        Now it's true that some companies can do something wildly inneficently or bad, in a way that can be figured out and profited from, happens all the time, but 
	        I think that it's more likely that you're going to re-invent the same exact thing if you don't have a deep understanding of the area.

	        I had an Idea for a new social media. Imagine if you carried around a little microcontroller with you that was always trying to send out your website via html encoded into some
	        wireless transmission format. At the same time imagine it was trying to recieve and download any html document that was sent out into the world to it. You 
	        could kinda make a human based internet via this and network more naturally. Say you're in a lecture hall and you see that your little microcontroller downloaded
	        some new pages from kids in your class. Check em out! maybe they have the same interests as you and you can hangout! It's really hard to find someone's webpage
	        on the internet if you don't have their name. Do kids make web pages anymore? no, not really. unless they're like nerdy. People don't have personal webpages anymore
	        which is a bit strange. People have instagram accounts, and the like. Someone mentioned that this was similar to a feature to the nintendo DS had, will checkout.

            I also make a post on the framework community page <a href="https://community.frame.work/t/new-idea-the-framepod-an-open-souce-ipod-classic-clone/66359">here</a> about
            a new open source ipod like device. It pisses me off when a piece of software becomes unavalable or unfindable, and its similar when I think about music. 
            I'm also pretty deeply against the subscription model from a user standpoint, blood sucking leeches. Some people thought it was cool, although it's clear
            how much more about computers that I need to learn if i'm going to make some sort of embedded linux system capable of running ipod like firmware.
            I'm not all that big of a fan or even a user of the framework laptops, but it seems like morally they're a good company. Although I don't really
            need a new ipod that's open source I don't listen to enough music to warrant it. Should I make it for money? becuase people would buy it?
            eh, who knows.

            Someone said that "You are what you think about all day" Maybe I'm like a computer or something. Was talking to a computer savvy friend about people who have 
            spent all their time learning about computers like forever. It seems like as with any subject this would slowly start to make you foreget what normale people are like.
            see <a href="https://xkcd.com/2501/">xkcd</a>
            I've been thinking about computers pretty frequently lately. I told them that maybe once I understand computers i'll go outside. Meaning that I'll explore
            the world more, checkout astronomy, maybe learn physics from the ground up. Ever wonder why KE = 1/2 mv^2 I have, where'd this come from? Emilie du chalet
            seems to have something to do with it.

            Does it matter if you do anything new? I don't really think so, there are much more important things. Some of me wonders how much of the easy fruit has been
            picked already and how much that that's your mind playing tricks on you becuase you were born when you were.

            If euler were around today, or gauss, or newton, would they not discover anything new? I think it's likely they would discover lots of new stuff. Imagine if they had 
            a computer! Imagine if they could just quickily check any conjecture they had up to giagantic numbers. I don't know who the geniuses of our day are.
